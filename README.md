# Identification-of-Rice-Varieties-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Commenced the project by calculating the contours of sample photos of the Arborio, Basmati, and Jasmine rice species. Carried out in-depth data research and complete feature extraction (colour, dimension). Ultimately, improved machine learning models enabling precise identification of rice species from photos.
